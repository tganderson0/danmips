# DanMIPS Simulator

## Download

You need the dan.html file, style.css, and script.js, or just clone the repository. To open, just open the dan.html file in your browser.

## Using

The program should be very similar to the MARS MIPS simulator, with a few differences. For loading and storing words, rather than calling something like 4($t1), the command is separated out into 3 sections, in a similar format to the other commands. The program loads with an example of most things, so that will help should what it looks like.
